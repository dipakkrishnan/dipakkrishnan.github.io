This is my first blog post using Jekyll.

## Why I started writing

I wanted a simple way to share my thoughts and technical learnings. Jekyll makes this easy - I just write in Markdown and push to GitHub.

## What's next

More posts coming soon on:

- Systems and infrastructure
- Machine learning
- Things I'm building

Stay tuned.
